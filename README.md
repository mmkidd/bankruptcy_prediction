# Bankruptcy Prediction Project

This project applies machine learning algorithms to the bankruptcy prediction problem. The project uses the dataset available at the UCI machine learning repository: [Polish company bankruptcy data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data). The primary finding of this paper is the efficacy of the [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) random forest model along with some investigation in to use of ensemble methods.
